# Native Direct-Call Worklog

This file records durable phase-level progress for future Codex and strategy sessions.

## Milestones

- Added Matrix SDK-backed custom content accessor for direct-call message-like events.
- Added and pinned the SDK custom timeline filter so the native direct-call receive path can observe the custom message-like signal event without changing the visible RoomScreen timeline.
- Hardened receive semantics so historical timeline reset/backlog direct-call events are ignored and only live post-baseline events are delivered to the engine.
- Proved two-client Matrix signalling end-to-end: invite, incoming ringing, accept, answer, and hangup/cleanup diagnostics.
- Proved diagnostic LiveKit media path can reach active under DEBUG/integration-only gates.
- Added production-shaped dependency seams for token, encryption, and media dependencies while keeping them fail-closed and inactive by default.
- Drafted the backend LiveKit token API contract for native direct calls.
- Added the SalemX call service backend skeleton for LiveKit token allocation.
- Added Synapse-backed room validation skeleton for requester/peer membership, encrypted room eligibility, and one-to-one validation.
- Added local backend fake smoke mode for the call service.
- Added app-side production token backend smoke coverage through an env-gated, disabled-by-default test harness.
- Added fail-closed app-side production media-key wrapping seams and shared LiveKit E2EE key-store injection hooks.
- Inspected Matrix Rust SDK crypto and FFI surfaces for a narrow production direct-call media-key wrapping seam.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10M Production E2EE Key Wrapping Seam Inspection

- Inspected `DirectCallEncryptionServiceProtocol`, `ProductionDirectCallEncryptionService`, diagnostic encryption, signal payload models, engine key lifecycle, LiveKit E2EE key store, and production dependency factory wiring.
- Confirmed production encryption remains intentionally fail-closed and is not connected to Matrix crypto or the LiveKit media key store.
- Confirmed the room-flow path already has the required room and peer metadata plus an existing injection point through `NativeDirectCallRoomFlowOwner`.
- Confirmed current app Matrix crypto proxies expose identity/key status only; they do not expose a narrow safe primitive for per-call media-key wrapping.
- Confirmed SDK room sending should encrypt the custom direct-call message-like event in encrypted rooms, but room encryption alone is not the production media-key wrapping design because the app must still hand only opaque wrapped key material to Matrix signalling.
- Found Rust SDK source has lower-level custom encrypted to-device support, but the current Swift app/wrapper does not expose an API that returns or consumes an opaque direct-call key envelope for the existing room-timeline signal path.
- Recommended the production key-exchange payload keep call, room, sender, key identifier, algorithm/version, sender device, recipient user, expiry, and opaque ciphertext fields, with per-device details hidden inside the opaque SDK-produced envelope where possible.
- Recommended multi-device handling wrap to all eligible peer devices and fail closed on unknown or unverifiable trust until UX/product policy exists.
- Identified that production key wrapping likely needs an async service boundary because Matrix crypto/device lookup is asynchronous.
- Recommended the next implementation phase as a fail-closed app seam skeleton that introduces a narrow key-wrapping protocol and shared media key-store bridge without real SDK crypto or production activation.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10N Production E2EE App Key-Wrapping Seam Skeleton

- Added production-shaped media key wrap/unwrap request and envelope models that carry call, room, sender, recipient, device, intent, expiry, key ID, and opaque envelope metadata with redacted descriptions.
- Added `DirectCallMediaKeyWrappingProtocol` and a default `FailClosedDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper` that cannot wrap or unwrap and never stores key material.
- Extended `ProductionDirectCallEncryptionService` so future production Matrix crypto wrapping can plug in with a shared `DirectCallLiveKitMediaKeyStore`.
- Kept the default production encryption path fail-closed when no wrapper, key store, own user metadata, or valid wrapped envelope is available.
- Updated `NativeDirectCallProductionDependenciesFactory` to accept a future key wrapper, own user/device metadata, and shared media key store while remaining disabled by default.
- Added focused production key-wrapping tests covering fail-closed behavior, fake wrapper generation/consume, metadata mismatch rejection, idempotent cleanup, and shared key-store factory wiring.
- Confirmed diagnostic encryption remains isolated and the production factory does not reference diagnostic-only types.
- Regenerated `SalemX.xcodeproj` so the new test file is part of the UnitTests target.
- Recommended next phase: prototype the narrow Matrix SDK/wrapper key wrapping seam that can replace the fail-closed wrapper without exposing raw Matrix JSON or media keys.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10O Matrix SDK Narrow Key Wrapping Seam Inspection

- Inspected Rust SDK crypto, device, to-device, room send, widget, FFI, and generated Swift binding surfaces in the local SDK and wrapper workspaces.
- Confirmed the Rust crypto layer can encrypt arbitrary custom to-device content for a device using Olm via `Device::encrypt_event_raw`.
- Confirmed the Rust crypto layer has multi-device support via `OlmMachine::encrypt_content_for_devices`, including trust-aware filtering through `CollectStrategy`.
- Confirmed the high-level SDK exposes an `encrypt_and_send_raw_to_device` helper behind the experimental custom to-device feature, and widget support already uses this path for encrypted custom to-device traffic.
- Confirmed the current Swift FFI bindings expose identity and trust state, but not a direct-call-specific wrapper that returns or consumes an opaque media-key envelope.
- Confirmed a separate production to-device key message is possible, but the safer next design keeps the existing room direct-call signal as the deterministic carrier and places only an SDK-produced opaque per-device envelope in that signal.
- Recommended a narrow SDK/FFI API that wraps the per-call media key into a redacted direct-call envelope and unwraps it on the recipient device without exposing Matrix event JSON or broad raw APIs.
- Identified that a real implementation will need async app integration because device lookup, session setup, and envelope generation/decryption are asynchronous.
- Recommended next phase: implement a local SDK prototype for `wrapDirectCallMediaKey` and `unwrapDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelope`, with focused Rust/FFI tests before publishing a wrapper artifact.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10P SDK Direct-Call Media Key Envelope Prototype

- Prototyped a narrow Matrix Rust SDK direct-call media-key envelope seam in the local SDK workspace.
- Added a direct-call-specific SDK module that models wrap info, unwrap info, an opaque envelope, unwrap result, trust policy, and redacted error cases.
- Added prototype SDK methods on `Encryption` for wrapping a per-call media key into an opaque envelope and unwrapping that envelope on an intended recipient device.
- Added FFI records and async methods that mirror the SDK API shape without exposing Matrix event JSON, device maps, or Olm internals to the app.
- Kept the existing direct-call room signal as the deterministic carrier; the prototype places only an SDK-produced opaque per-device envelope into that signal.
- Validated envelope metadata, expiry, intended recipient, event type, and SDK decryption sender metadata on unwrap before returning media key material to the app encryption boundary.
- Added focused SDK tests for redacted debug output, malformed envelope handling, metadata mismatch, and expiry fail-closed behavior.
- Confirmed `cargo check -p matrix-sdk-ffi` passes for the prototype.
- Confirmed `cargo test -p matrix-sdk --features experimental-send-custom-to-device direct_call --lib` passes.
- Did not publish wrapper artifacts, update the app dependency pin, modify app production code, or activate production direct calls.
- Identified the next blocker: add full cryptographic SDK round-trip tests using real test devices before generating Swift bindings or publishing an artifact.
