# Native Direct-Call Worklog

This file records durable phase-level progress for future Codex and strategy sessions.

## Milestones

- Added Matrix SDK-backed custom content accessor for direct-call message-like events.
- Added and pinned the SDK custom timeline filter so the native direct-call receive path can observe the custom message-like signal event without changing the visible RoomScreen timeline.
- Hardened receive semantics so historical timeline reset/backlog direct-call events are ignored and only live post-baseline events are delivered to the engine.
- Proved two-client Matrix signalling end-to-end: invite, incoming ringing, accept, answer, and hangup/cleanup diagnostics.
- Proved diagnostic LiveKit media path can reach active under DEBUG/integration-only gates.
- Added production-shaped dependency seams for token, encryption, and media dependencies while keeping them fail-closed and inactive by default.
- Drafted the backend LiveKit token API contract for native direct calls.
- Added the SalemX call service backend skeleton for LiveKit token allocation.
- Added Synapse-backed room validation skeleton for requester/peer membership, encrypted room eligibility, and one-to-one validation.
- Added local backend fake smoke mode for the call service.
- Added app-side production token backend smoke coverage through an env-gated, disabled-by-default test harness.
- Added fail-closed app-side production media-key wrapping seams and shared LiveKit E2EE key-store injection hooks.
- Inspected Matrix Rust SDK crypto and FFI surfaces for a narrow production direct-call media-key wrapping seam.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10M Production E2EE Key Wrapping Seam Inspection

- Inspected `DirectCallEncryptionServiceProtocol`, `ProductionDirectCallEncryptionService`, diagnostic encryption, signal payload models, engine key lifecycle, LiveKit E2EE key store, and production dependency factory wiring.
- Confirmed production encryption remains intentionally fail-closed and is not connected to Matrix crypto or the LiveKit media key store.
- Confirmed the room-flow path already has the required room and peer metadata plus an existing injection point through `NativeDirectCallRoomFlowOwner`.
- Confirmed current app Matrix crypto proxies expose identity/key status only; they do not expose a narrow safe primitive for per-call media-key wrapping.
- Confirmed SDK room sending should encrypt the custom direct-call message-like event in encrypted rooms, but room encryption alone is not the production media-key wrapping design because the app must still hand only opaque wrapped key material to Matrix signalling.
- Found Rust SDK source has lower-level custom encrypted to-device support, but the current Swift app/wrapper does not expose an API that returns or consumes an opaque direct-call key envelope for the existing room-timeline signal path.
- Recommended the production key-exchange payload keep call, room, sender, key identifier, algorithm/version, sender device, recipient user, expiry, and opaque ciphertext fields, with per-device details hidden inside the opaque SDK-produced envelope where possible.
- Recommended multi-device handling wrap to all eligible peer devices and fail closed on unknown or unverifiable trust until UX/product policy exists.
- Identified that production key wrapping likely needs an async service boundary because Matrix crypto/device lookup is asynchronous.
- Recommended the next implementation phase as a fail-closed app seam skeleton that introduces a narrow key-wrapping protocol and shared media key-store bridge without real SDK crypto or production activation.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10N Production E2EE App Key-Wrapping Seam Skeleton

- Added production-shaped media key wrap/unwrap request and envelope models that carry call, room, sender, recipient, device, intent, expiry, key ID, and opaque envelope metadata with redacted descriptions.
- Added `DirectCallMediaKeyWrappingProtocol` and a default `FailClosedDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper` that cannot wrap or unwrap and never stores key material.
- Extended `ProductionDirectCallEncryptionService` so future production Matrix crypto wrapping can plug in with a shared `DirectCallLiveKitMediaKeyStore`.
- Kept the default production encryption path fail-closed when no wrapper, key store, own user metadata, or valid wrapped envelope is available.
- Updated `NativeDirectCallProductionDependenciesFactory` to accept a future key wrapper, own user/device metadata, and shared media key store while remaining disabled by default.
- Added focused production key-wrapping tests covering fail-closed behavior, fake wrapper generation/consume, metadata mismatch rejection, idempotent cleanup, and shared key-store factory wiring.
- Confirmed diagnostic encryption remains isolated and the production factory does not reference diagnostic-only types.
- Regenerated `SalemX.xcodeproj` so the new test file is part of the UnitTests target.
- Recommended next phase: prototype the narrow Matrix SDK/wrapper key wrapping seam that can replace the fail-closed wrapper without exposing raw Matrix JSON or media keys.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10O Matrix SDK Narrow Key Wrapping Seam Inspection

- Inspected Rust SDK crypto, device, to-device, room send, widget, FFI, and generated Swift binding surfaces in the local SDK and wrapper workspaces.
- Confirmed the Rust crypto layer can encrypt arbitrary custom to-device content for a device using Olm via `Device::encrypt_event_raw`.
- Confirmed the Rust crypto layer has multi-device support via `OlmMachine::encrypt_content_for_devices`, including trust-aware filtering through `CollectStrategy`.
- Confirmed the high-level SDK exposes an `encrypt_and_send_raw_to_device` helper behind the experimental custom to-device feature, and widget support already uses this path for encrypted custom to-device traffic.
- Confirmed the current Swift FFI bindings expose identity and trust state, but not a direct-call-specific wrapper that returns or consumes an opaque media-key envelope.
- Confirmed a separate production to-device key message is possible, but the safer next design keeps the existing room direct-call signal as the deterministic carrier and places only an SDK-produced opaque per-device envelope in that signal.
- Recommended a narrow SDK/FFI API that wraps the per-call media key into a redacted direct-call envelope and unwraps it on the recipient device without exposing Matrix event JSON or broad raw APIs.
- Identified that a real implementation will need async app integration because device lookup, session setup, and envelope generation/decryption are asynchronous.
- Recommended next phase: implement a local SDK prototype for `wrapDirectCallMediaKey` and `unwrapDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelope`, with focused Rust/FFI tests before publishing a wrapper artifact.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10P SDK Direct-Call Media Key Envelope Prototype

- Prototyped a narrow Matrix Rust SDK direct-call media-key envelope seam in the local SDK workspace.
- Added a direct-call-specific SDK module that models wrap info, unwrap info, an opaque envelope, unwrap result, trust policy, and redacted error cases.
- Added prototype SDK methods on `Encryption` for wrapping a per-call media key into an opaque envelope and unwrapping that envelope on an intended recipient device.
- Added FFI records and async methods that mirror the SDK API shape without exposing Matrix event JSON, device maps, or Olm internals to the app.
- Kept the existing direct-call room signal as the deterministic carrier; the prototype places only an SDK-produced opaque per-device envelope into that signal.
- Validated envelope metadata, expiry, intended recipient, event type, and SDK decryption sender metadata on unwrap before returning media key material to the app encryption boundary.
- Added focused SDK tests for redacted debug output, malformed envelope handling, metadata mismatch, and expiry fail-closed behavior.
- Confirmed `cargo check -p matrix-sdk-ffi` passes for the prototype.
- Confirmed `cargo test -p matrix-sdk --features experimental-send-custom-to-device direct_call --lib` passes.
- Did not publish wrapper artifacts, update the app dependency pin, modify app production code, or activate production direct calls.
- Identified the next blocker: add full cryptographic SDK round-trip tests using real test devices before generating Swift bindings or publishing an artifact.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10Q SDK Direct-Call Media Key Envelope Crypto Tests

- Added high-level Matrix SDK tests that prove the direct-call media key envelope can be wrapped and unwrapped cryptographically through the prototype SDK API.
- Used `MatrixMockServer` crypto helpers to create Alice and Bob clients with mocked Matrix crypto endpoints, device keys, one-time-key claiming, and encrypted room state.
- Proved Alice can wrap a per-call media key into an opaque envelope for Bob and Bob can unwrap it back to the original key material.
- Proved the opaque envelope serialization and debug output do not contain the test media key material.
- Added fail-closed coverage for wrong call ID, room ID, sender, recipient, intent, and key ID.
- Added non-recipient coverage showing a third client cannot unwrap an Alice-to-Bob envelope.
- Added conservative trust-policy coverage showing `OnlyTrustedDevices` rejects the current unverified test peer device set with `TrustViolation`.
- Added multi-device coverage showing envelopes include all eligible Bob devices and Bob's second device can unwrap the envelope.
- Confirmed `cargo test -p matrix-sdk --features experimental-send-custom-to-device direct_call --lib` passes.
- Confirmed `cargo check -p matrix-sdk-ffi` passes.
- Committed the SDK prototype and crypto tests as `f7c2cfe5c Add direct-call media key envelope crypto tests`.
- Did not publish wrapper artifacts, update the app dependency pin, modify app production code, or activate production direct calls.
- Recommended next phase: build/publish the Swift wrapper artifact from the proven SDK commit, then adapt the app key-wrapping seam to async SDK-backed wrapping in a later phase.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10R Matrix SDK Direct-Call Key Envelope Wrapper Publication

- Revalidated the SDK commit `f7c2cfe5c Add direct-call media key envelope crypto tests` with `cargo check -p matrix-sdk-ffi` and focused `direct_call` SDK tests.
- Created and pushed SDK tag `salemx-direct-call-key-envelope-f7c2cfe5c`.
- Built a full Release `MatrixSDKFFI.xcframework` for iOS device and simulator targets from the proven SDK commit.
- Published the reproducible artifact at the Matrix SDK release URL and verified the downloaded checksum: `654f7433a6f5a5782abd8aa4d4c2a429a41d679e0612bf38bc05541e7126420e`.
- Regenerated the Swift wrapper bindings so MatrixRustSDK exposes the direct-call media key envelope records and async wrap/unwrap methods.
- Updated wrapper `Package.swift` to use the real release asset URL and checksum, with no local binary target path.
- Validated wrapper `swift package resolve`, `swift package describe`, API presence, path scan, and `git diff --check`.
- Committed wrapper changes as `1e58d0a Add direct-call media key envelope bindings` and tagged `salemx-matrix-rust-components-swift-26.03.10-salemx.3`.
- Pinned the app to wrapper commit `1e58d0a4317e3ff74c2d565cf532bc8d035bcc8f` in `project.yml`, the generated Xcode project, and `compound-ios/Package.resolved`.
- Ran focused app unit tests for production key wrapping and media engine coverage after the pin.
- Ran the app Release build after the pin.
- Kept production direct calls disabled; no visible UI, Element Call route, CallKit, push, or production feature activation was changed.
- Recommended next phase: adapt the app production key-wrapping seam to the async SDK envelope API while preserving fail-closed default behavior.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10S App Async Matrix SDK Key Wrapper Skeleton

- Inspected the generated MatrixRustSDK Swift API from the pinned wrapper artifact.
- Confirmed the direct-call media key envelope SDK methods are async on `EncryptionProtocol`:
  - `wrapDirectCallMediaKey(info:)`
  - `unwrapDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelope(info:envelope:)`
- Confirmed the generated SDK models carry call, room, sender, recipient, intent, key ID, expiry, and opaque ciphertext metadata without exposing raw Matrix event JSON.
- Migrated the app key wrapping boundary to async in `DirectCallMediaKeyWrappingProtocol`.
- Migrated `DirectCallEncryptionServiceProtocol` key generation and remote key consume methods to async, with `DirectCallEngine` awaiting them in already-async call paths.
- Added `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper`, a production-shaped adapter that maps app wrap/unwrap request models to the generated SDK FFI models and maps SDK envelopes/results back to app models.
- Kept the SDK-backed wrapper fail-closed when no SDK encryption dependency is injected.
- Kept `FailClosedDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper` as the default production wrapper and did not inject the SDK-backed wrapper into runtime production dependencies.
- Added tests with a fake SDK adapter proving request mapping, envelope/result mapping, SDK failure mapping, redacted descriptions, and fail-closed missing dependency behavior.
- Confirmed diagnostic encryption remains compatible with the async protocol and still isolated behind DEBUG/integration gates.
- Ran focused app unit tests for production key wrapping, direct-call engine, and media engine coverage.
- Ran the app Release build.
- Committed app changes as `9882b6ffa Add async Matrix SDK direct-call key wrapper`.
- Recommended next phase: inspect or add the narrow production dependency injection seam that supplies a Matrix SDK direct-call key envelope wrapper to the production factory while keeping runtime activation disabled.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10T Production SDK Key Wrapper Injection Seam

- Inspected the app-side async `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper`, production encryption service, production dependency factory, room-flow ownership path, and SDK proxy boundaries.
- Chose a narrow dependency seam on `NativeDirectCallProductionDependenciesFactory` instead of exposing `MatrixRustSDK.EncryptionProtocol` or raw SDK client access through app-wide room/client protocols.
- Added support for passing `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelopeWrappingProtocol` into the production dependencies factory.
- The factory now constructs `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper` from that narrow envelope wrapper when production dependencies are explicitly enabled.
- Preserved explicit `DirectCallMediaKeyWrappingProtocol` precedence so tests and future runtime integration can override the SDK wrapper cleanly.
- Preserved default fail-closed behavior: missing production config or missing wrapper still leaves production dependencies disabled or backed by `FailClosedDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper`.
- Added tests proving the factory can construct and use the SDK-backed wrapper from the narrow envelope seam, and that an explicit wrapper prevents SDK wrapper use.
- Confirmed no visible UI, Element Call route, CallKit, push, production feature flag, broad raw API, or diagnostic secret/token path changed.
- Ran focused direct-call and RoomFlow unit tests, Release build, SwiftFormat/SwiftLint on changed files, `git diff --check`, and the direct-call forbidden scan.
- Committed app changes as `000d1f12d Add production key wrapper injection seam`.
- Recommended next phase: inspect/add a runtime provider seam that can obtain the SDK encryption object from the session/client layer and expose only a direct-call envelope wrapper to production dependency construction.

## 2026-05-12 — 2.10U Production Runtime SDK Key Wrapper Provider Seam

- Inspected the SDK-backed key wrapper, production dependency factory, `ClientProxy`, room-flow construction path, and existing SDK encryption usage.
- Added `DirectCallMediaKeyEnvelopeWrappingProviding`, a narrow provider protocol that exposes only a direct-call media key envelope wrapper.
- Kept broad app protocols unchanged: `ClientProxyProtocol`, `RoomProxyProtocol`, and `TimelineProxyProtocol` do not expose raw MatrixRustSDK client, room, timeline, event JSON, or crypto APIs.
- Made concrete `ClientProxy` provide `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelopeWrapperAdapter` from its private `client.encryption()` dependency.
- Updated `NativeDirectCallProductionDependenciesFactory` to use dependencies in safe precedence order:
  - explicit `DirectCallMediaKeyWrappingProtocol`
  - explicit `MatrixSDKDirectCallMediaKeyEnvelopeWrappingProtocol`
  - runtime `DirectCallMediaKeyEnvelopeWrappingProviding`
  - `FailClosedDirectCallMediaKeyWrapper`
- Ensured the factory does not ask the runtime provider while production configuration is disabled.
- Added tests proving provider-absent fail-closed behavior, provider-backed SDK wrapper construction, and explicit wrapper precedence.
- Confirmed diagnostic direct-call encryption and LiveKit paths remain unaffected.
- Ran `git diff --check`, SwiftFormat/SwiftLint on changed Swift files, focused direct-call and RoomFlow unit tests, Release build, and the direct-call forbidden scan.
- Committed app changes as `2f8bc409a Add production key envelope provider seam`.
- Recommended next phase: inspect/add a disabled production dependency assembly seam that can combine production config, token transport/auth, LiveKit client, shared media key store, and the key envelope provider without activating UI or production direct calls.

## 2026-05-13 — 2.10V Disabled Production Direct-Call Dependency Wiring

- Inspected production direct-call dependency construction across the production configuration, token client, HTTP transport, Matrix access-token provider, LiveKit client, SDK key envelope provider, and room-flow ownership seams.
- Added `NativeDirectCallProductionDependencyAssembly`, a disabled-by-default assembly seam that combines explicit production configuration with injected runtime providers.
- The assembly requires production config, HTTP transport, Matrix access-token provider, LiveKit client, key envelope provider, and own user ID before creating production dependencies.
- Missing configuration or any required runtime provider returns disabled/fail-closed dependencies.
- The assembly creates `ProductionDirectCallLiveKitTokenClient` from injected transport/auth only when explicitly configured, preserving the no-real-network-by-default behavior.
- Added narrow `ClientProxy` conformance to `DirectCallMatrixAccessTokenProviding` so future runtime wiring can provide the Matrix access token without broadening `ClientProxyProtocol`.
- Added tests proving default-disabled behavior, missing-provider fail-closed behavior, and fully injected assembly behavior using fake HTTP/auth/LiveKit/key-envelope providers.
- Confirmed diagnostic direct-call encryption and LiveKit paths remain isolated behind DEBUG/integration gates.
- Ran `git diff --check`, SwiftFormat/SwiftLint on changed Swift files, focused direct-call and RoomFlow unit tests, Release build, and the direct-call forbidden scan.
- Committed app changes as `e9a1c8d1f Add disabled production direct-call dependency wiring`.
- Recommended next phase: inspect/add a guarded production room-flow injection seam that can pass assembled production dependencies to native direct-call room ownership without activating visible UI or production direct calls.

## 2026-05-13 — 2.10W Production Activation Gate Design Inspection

- Inspected `AppSettings`, existing feature flags, `directOneToOneCallsEnabled`, remote settings hooks, Element well-known handling, client/server capability surfaces, AppCoordinator session setup, flow coordinator injection, and native direct-call production dependency assembly.
- Confirmed `directOneToOneCallsEnabled` should not be reused as the native production activation switch because it currently belongs to the existing direct-call/Element Call placeholder path and explicitly logs that production signal transport is disabled.
- Recommended a multi-factor activation model: app rollout configuration, authenticated server capability, token endpoint discovery, production dependency readiness, encrypted 1:1 room eligibility, and future UI/CallKit readiness.
- Recommended a SalemX-specific Matrix client capability as the authoritative production server gate, instead of a local Developer Options toggle or diagnostic environment variable.
- Recommended endpoint discovery through an authenticated capability that advertises a same-origin relative token endpoint, with the existing unstable token path as the default contract.
- Recommended `.well-known` only for pre-auth hints or account/provider policy, not as sufficient production activation authority.
- Confirmed diagnostics must remain separate: DEBUG/integration env gates and runner tokens/secrets must not affect production activation.
- Did not modify app code, activate production direct calls, add UI, change Element Call routing, or wire CallKit/push.
- Recommended next phase: add a fail-closed production activation gate/configuration skeleton and capability DTOs/tests without threading it into visible runtime behavior.
